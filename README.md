This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


# Aptogotchi (Beginner)
Aptogotchi is a full-stack dApp to demonstrate the basics of how to build a dApp using Move. 

We want to introduce the following concepts:
1. how to create a full-stack dApp 
2. how to talk to the smart contracts on blockchain
2. how to integrate with wallet/explorer/ANS and other services.
2. how to create events and using indexer to get the off-chain data.
3. how to write unit tests for the smart contracts.

This dapp will be ussing as an educational demo hosted on [Builder Hub](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-builder-hub).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
